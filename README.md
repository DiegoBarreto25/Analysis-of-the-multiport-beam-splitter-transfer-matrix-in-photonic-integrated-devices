This repository contains the code used to calculate the process fidelity between the second-order perturbation theory transfer matrix and the analytical solution for $ \kappa \approx 0.04 , \mu\text{m}^{-1} $, adjusting the delta parameter until the resulting change in fidelity is on the order of 0.01. This code is used in figure 4
