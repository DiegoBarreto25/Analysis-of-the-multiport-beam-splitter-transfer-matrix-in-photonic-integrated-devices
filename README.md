This repository contains the code used to calculate the process fidelity between the second-order perturbation theory transfer matrix and the analytical solution for 𝜅 ≈ 0.04 𝜇m−1 , adjusting the delta parameter until the resulting change in fidelity is on the order of 0.01. This code is used in figure 4
